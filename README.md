# 16BitOS

## My abstraction of a 16-bit operating system from NAND gates.

## This project is composed of abstractions:

* Abstraction 1: Boolean Gates to Multiplexors

* Abstraction 2: Adders and Arithmetic Logic Unit

* Abstraction 3: Registers to Random Access Memory 8-bit to 16Kb and Program Counter

* Abstraction 4: Memory Bus of RAM, Screen, and Keyboard; 16-bit Central Processing Unit; and 32Kb ROM to Complete Computer Hardware Abstraction

* Abstraction 5: Assembler, C Instruction Mapper, Parser, Linker, Symbol Table

* Abstraction 6: Compiler, Code Writer, and Stack to Virtual Machine Translator

* Abstraction 7: Operating System, Virtual Machine, Classes, Nested Function Calls, Arithmetic, Program Control
